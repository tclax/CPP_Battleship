Things to consider:

Goal:
	Create a battleship simulator to win a game of battleship in the least amount of turns as possible. 
	A standard battleship game has the following  sizes and ships: 5 - Carrier, 4 - Battleship, 3 - Submarine, 3 - Destroyer, 2 - Patrol
	5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 15
	The best case scenario score to get is to win in 15 moves, this will require perfect predictions.
	The worst case scenario score to get is the board width x board height. Typically the board is 8x8 so the worst possible score to get is 64.

How will the battleship boards be represented?
	2d array
	Linked nodes
	Boards should be able to be 
	Array of size 64 (board width x board height)


How will the ship pieces will be represented?
	Tiles on the board will either be empty or a ship.
	Each tile will have a state: hit, miss, unknown
	The board will need to display differently per player.
    Player1 vs Player2
	Player1 vs Computer
	Computer1 vs Computer2 (most interested in this)
		

How will the computer make moves?
	Needs a method to choose a strategy.
	Based on strategy selected result, keep using that strategy or move to a another stragey based on previous boards.
	Keep in memory all the boards created to develop a strategy.

How will a winner be determined?
	All ships are sunk on the players board
